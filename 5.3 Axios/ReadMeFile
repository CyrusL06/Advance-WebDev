What if you wanna create an app where server is needed to make API request?

this is the common needs

so we use native node and axios

using axios is simplified for using req into one line

Using Axios:



import axios "axios;"
 
app.get("/", async (req, res) => {
  try {
    const response await axios.get("url.com")
    res.render("index.ejs", {activity: response-data})
  } catch {error} {
    console.log("Failed to make request");
    res.status(500).send("Failed tp fetch activity, Please Try Again")
    
  }
})
